The objective of the game is to grow a "neon-bridge" suitable for the player to cross the distance between the two blocks.<br>
The user can grow a neon-bridge holding and releasing the spacebar, if the user has managed to land the neon bridge on the bonus, he will get an extra point. However if the neon-bridge is too short or too long, the game is over.<br>
